C++ Containers Overview
In C++, containers are a key part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and are used to store collections of objects. Containers are broadly categorized into three types: Sequence Containers, Associative Containers, and Unordered Containers. Each category serves different purposes and has specific characteristics.

1. Sequence Containers
Sequence containers store elements in a linear order, where the order of elements matters. They allow efficient access to elements and support operations like insertion and deletion.

vector: A dynamic array that allows fast random access and efficient insertion/removal at the end. It's ideal for situations where the number of elements can change frequently.

deque: A double-ended queue that allows efficient insertion and deletion at both the beginning and the end. It offers similar functionality to vector but with more flexibility in where elements can be added or removed.

list: A doubly-linked list that allows efficient insertion and deletion from anywhere in the list, but slower random access. It's useful when frequent insertion/removal of elements in the middle of the sequence is required.

array: A fixed-size array with static allocation. It provides fast access to elements and is useful when the number of elements is known at compile time.

forward_list: A singly-linked list that supports fast insertion and deletion but only allows traversal in one direction. It uses less memory than list due to the absence of backward links.

2. Associative Containers
Associative containers store elements in a sorted order based on their keys, allowing fast retrieval based on keys.

map: Stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique and the elements are automatically sorted by key. It allows efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion based on keys.

multimap: Similar to map, but allows multiple elements with the same key. Useful when duplicate keys need to be stored.

set: A collection of unique keys, stored in sorted order. It's optimized for fast lookups and is useful when you need to store unique elements.

multiset: Like set, but allows duplicate elements. Useful when the frequency of elements needs to be tracked.

3. Unordered Containers
Unordered containers are similar to associative containers but do not maintain any order. Instead, they use hash tables to provide fast access to elements.

unordered_map: Similar to map, but stores elements in an arbitrary order based on their hash values. This typically provides faster access compared to map.

unordered_multimap: Like unordered_map, but allows multiple entries with the same key.

unordered_set: A collection of unique keys, stored in an arbitrary order. Provides faster access than set in most cases.

unordered_multiset: Like unordered_set, but allows duplicate keys.
